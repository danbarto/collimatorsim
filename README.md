collimatorsim
=============

A piece of software for additional functionality of the SixTrack software package. Developed for the feasibility study of the HP-PS (high power proton synchrotron) at CERN.

Please note that this project is coded for functionality, not beauty. It has grown from a 100 lines of code automation tool and therefore may confuse the reader. I apologize for that.

As I don't have much time for improving this code, please feel free to participate and improve it!
